This is a Voting dApp built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/).

Maintaining high-standard privacy and preventing vote tampering can be tough when developing voting apps, but incorporating Blockchain technology into an app can help you overcome these challenges.
Votechain is a Blockchain Voting Application that provides data integrity, data security, reduced fraud, and improved accountability when it comes to voting. This eliminates a single point of failure and protects personal information.
